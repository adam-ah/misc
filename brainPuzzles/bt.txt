iNtroduCtioN 
For years, numerous people have asked me to write this book after 
they were intrigued with working on these and similar problems that 
appeared in the various newspapers and airline magazines I write for. 
The problems in this book are my best and most interesting selections 
that will get you to think and increase your creativity. They 
will also help you develop your intelligence so that you will do better 
on all standardized tests , including the SAT, ACT, GMAT, LSAT, 
and GRE. Most importantly, they will give you something to look 
forward to and enjoy aside from your daily routine. 

Many entries include an interesting anecdote about the problem 
and why it is so baffling, so you will get insight into a new way to 
think. I have also provided detailed explanations (some of which 
I have never before divulged) for the more difficult problems. 
Whatever your daily routine may be, the brain teasers in this book 


will challenge you to use your mind in a highly productive and rewarding 
way. 

My Story 

When I was in fifth grade, I had to take an IQ test. I scored 90, which 
is below normal and considered “dull.” Although I was not told my 
IQ, I noticed that my teachers were not paying much attention to 
me and were patronizing me as if I were stupid. Later, as friends of 
mine were skipping grades, I was routed to the “dull classes,” which 
embarrassed me and made me feel inferior. I felt as if I would never 
get far in life. 

I was in seventh grade when a math teacher at my junior high 
school in Brooklyn, New York, told my father that he was shocked 
that I had only a 90 IQ. To my teacher, I seemed much smarter than 
that. My father was shocked to learn that I had scored a 90 on the IQ 
test and obtained an IQ test that was currently being administered. 
He gave me the test. 

However, instead of actually taking it (as I had before), I started 
looking the test over to see what had caused me to get such a low 
score. This started my fascination with testing and critical thinking. I 
realized that certain thinking skills were being tested and that a person 
could actually develop those skills and hone them. I also noticed 
that there was a generic process to problem solving and thinking. This 
process was based on extracting something curious from a problem 
and using that to find the rest of the solution. This process provided 

v 
i 
i 
i

the mechanism to think by “synthesizing” rather than just panic and 
rush to find an answer. As my school career unfolded, I increased my 
IQ to 126. I then increased the development of my thinking skills and 
obtained a 150. 

I developed an obsession with seeing how problems can be solved. 
I eventually got accepted into an elite high school, and I started commenting 
on teachers’ exams by noting on my paper, “This question 
could be made more interesting by adding so and so,” or “This is a 
poor question; use this instead of that.” Most of my teachers did not 
find this amusing (I even got detention for this behavior), but a few 
did—the ones who had a real interest in the learning mechanism. I 
started to become fascinated in how nature works, why things work 
the way they do, and how problems can be solved. This launched my 
interest in physics. 

But after receiving my PhD, teaching, doing some high-powered 
research in physics, and even getting invited all over the world to 
lecture on some of the theories I developed, I realized that there was 
a much more serious problem to solve. There were all these young 
people out there who were branded like I was—dull—and were 
not given an opportunity to show their true talents and perhaps 
even genius. I felt like I was living in Thomas Gray’s poem “Elegy 
Written in a Country Churchyard” in which he writes, “Many a 
flower is born to blush unseen and waste its sweet fragrance on 
the desert air.” I realized I had a mission in life. There are all these 
people out there who could be great scientists, journalists, or other 

i 
x 



professionals, people who could develop their talents and become 
passionate about their life’s work and provide us with the breakthroughs 
we need so much. Therefore, I turned my interest and 
passion into the quest for how people can solve problems and learn, 
and how they can enjoy and develop a passion for learning and 
problem solving. I devoted my life to test taking, test development, 
critical thinking, and learning. And to my amazement I noticed, 
after thirty years of research, that most if not all strategies for thinking, 
learning, and problem solving are based on common sense and 
not racking your brain.

the GeoMetry ProbleM

the GeoMetry ProbleM 
that StuMPed the NatioN 
Some time ago, I wrote an article titled “Are You a Genius?” 
that was published in newspapers all over the country. It was a 
twelve-question test to determine genius IQ. I received hundreds 
of letters from readers who could not solve the last and rather 
simple-looking geometry question. When I was a high school 
student in New York, it took me three hours to solve this problem. 
However, forty years later, even after being able to write 
thirty books on the subject of test preparation and thinking, even 
I could not solve the problem—and it was driving me crazy! Was 
I getting stupider as the years passed? 

So I decided to reprint the twelve-question test, and if someone got 
all twelve questions right, they would be called a super genius. I was 
hoping someone would be able to solve the last question and then tell 
me how they did it. I didn’t get any answers, but I did receive tons 


of letters asking how the twelfth problem could be geometrically 
solved. People at the highest levels in math at major universities, 
government agencies, you name it, could not solve the problem. 

Then I got an urgent call on a Friday from the Washington Post 
telling me that they were getting hundreds of calls every few hours 
asking for a solution to the problem. I told them I could not do 
it. Well, that wasn’t good enough for them. They said I’d better 
have the solution to them in four days, or else! Or else what? They 
couldn’t sue me. For forty years I couldn’t solve the problem and 
now I had to solve it in four days. Didn’t I have better things to do 
over the weekend? Well, I contacted everyone I knew who was literally 
a genius in math, including top mathematicians in the country. 
I contacted fellow math students whom I hadn’t talked to in thirty 
years, who went to school with me, and who were super math savvy 
and may have seen the problem. They were all eager to work on 
it. However, Sunday rolled around and no one responded with a 
solution. People from NASA, major math departments all over the 
country, and even the top mathematicians at Educational Testing 
Service (the company that develops the majority of entrance, aptitude, 
and achievement tests such as the SAT) could not solve the 
problem. In fact, one person was completely peeved, having worked 
10 hours straight without a solution! 

Then as a very last resort, I was able, by researching and making 
about twenty calls, to contact my old math professor who had given 
me the original problem to work on thirty years ago. But when I 

x 
i 
i 



called him (he must have been somewhat senile), he told me that 
I was late for class and I’d better hand in my assignments. He kept 
repeating it—what a bummer! The last person on earth who could 
have given me the answer was incoherent! The next day I frantically 
called the whiz kids I went to school with who were working on the 
problem and asked for any hints they thought I might use. Each one 
of them told me to use my own specific math strategies that I have 
been writing about for years and using in all my test-preparation and 
thinking books. For example, in geometry when you want to prove 
that if two sides of a triangle are equal then the base angles are equal, 
the strategy you use is to draw a line down the triangle. This works 
because, almost magically, when you draw something extra, you get 
something for it—namely more information and an approach to the 
solution. I never thought about that because I thought this problem 
was too sophisticated! It was Monday night now and I was working 
feverishly on the problem using my very own strategies. The morning 
of the deadline came around, and I had just finished solving the problem. 
I told this to the Washington Post, and they printed a full-page 
solution—writing me up as “the super genius.” 

There are actually now six ways to solve the problem, and in this 
book I’ll show the simplest one. See if you can figure it out. Turn to 
page 182 for the answer! 

Given a triangle ABC, side AB = side AC. Draw a line from C to 
side AB. Call that line CD. Now draw a line from B to side AC. Call 
that line BE. Let angle EBC = 60 degrees, angle BCD = 70 degrees,

angle ABE = 20 degrees, and angle DCE = 10 degrees. Now draw 
line DE. Find angle EDC. Do not do this trigonometrically; do it 
geometrically to get an exact answer.

Here is a collection of my most interesting and mind-improving brain 
teasers. Many of the answers should give you a strategy for thinking, 
which will carry over to many other problems and provide you with 
thinking and problem-solving methods. There is no time limit for 
these questions (with exceptions as noted). Be aware that there may 
be more than one way to arrive at an answer to a question. 

Just remember, a person who can solve problems efficiently either 
knows a particular strategy for the type of problem or extracts something 
from the problem that is curious to him or her and that leads to 
the next step toward a solution.

claim: His client went to an art museum, where he saw a painting 
of Marie Antoinette on a guillotine. He fell asleep and dreamed 
of the painting. At the museum’s closing time, a guard tapped 
him on the neck just as he dreamed of the guillotine beheading 
Marie Antoinette. The tap provoked immediate cardiac arrest 
and a fatal heart attack immediately following, because he associated 
the tap with the guillotine blade. Why did the judge

Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow: 

Sometimes the meaning of glowing water is ominous. Off the 
Pacific coast of North America, it may mean that the sea is 
filled with a minute plant that contains a poison of strange 
and terrible virulence. About four days after this minute plant 
comes to dominate the coastal plankton, some of the fishes 
and shellfish in the vicinity become toxic. This is because in 
their normal feeding, they have strained the poisonous plankton 
out of the water.

This problem had baffled three Physics Nobel Prize winners— 
and it doesn’t seem that hard! 
Note: This question is much more difficult than problem 146, 
where you know that the “odd” ball is heavier than the rest. 

Twelve balls are identical in all ways except one has a different 
weight. Three weighings on a balance scale will not only identify 
the odd ball, but also tell whether it is heavier or lighter. 
How many balls must be put on each side of the scale in the 
first weighing, the second weighing, and the third weighing? 

Answer should be in this form (this is only a sample answer, 
not necessarily the correct one): 
First weighing—six against six 
Second weighing—three against three 
Third weighing—one against one

A teacher shows three very bright students three red hats and 
two white ones. The students are then blindfolded and the 
teacher puts one hat on each of their heads and the remaining 
hats in a closed bag. The first student removes his blindfold 
and is able only to see the other two students’ hats. He says 
he cannot say for certain the color of his own hat. 

After hearing the first student, the second student removes 
her blindfold, sees the other two students’ hats, and says that 
she cannot say for certain the color of her own hat. After 
thinking and without removing his blindfold, the last student 
says he knows the color of his hat. Which is false? Note: Any 
combination of a, b, c, d, and e may be the correct answer. 

(a) The third student has enough information to determine

A quarter and a nickel 
Be careful of what the wording says: One is not a nickel, but 
the other is. This is a standard trick in the English language. 
When you say, “one of them is not a nickel,” it doesn’t mean 
that both are not nickels. The key strategy is to pay attention 
to the wording and not assume anything. The mind gets lured 
into a process that seems natural. So if you hear someone say, 
“one of them is not a nickel,” you may assume that the person 
means that both are not nickels. But the statement “one is not 
a nickel” does not imply that the other cannot be a nickel.

Average rate is not the average of the rates, and the answer is 
not 40. Also, the distance does not need to be known. Where 
a and b are the two rates, the average rate can be shown to be 
2ab/(a + b), so 2(20)(60)/(20 + 60) = 30. 

Detailed explanation: Average rate = Total distance/Total 
time. Let’s say the distance is D one way. Then the total 
distance is 2D. Let’s say the time the car travels 20 mph is 
t and the time the car travels 60 mph is T. Then from the 
formula Rate × Time = Distance, 20 × t = D and 60 × T = D. 
This gives you t = D/20 and T = D/60. So the total time is 
t + T = D/20 + D/60. This is equal to t + T = 80D/1,200 = D/15. 
So the average rate = 2D/(t + T) = 2D/(D/15) = 30.

Thirteen nickels, one dime, and one quarter 
The cleverest way to solve this problem is to try to reduce the 
number of possibilities to a minimum and then figure out all 
of those possibilities. The highest number of quarters I can 
have is three, since if I have at least one of every coin, I can’t 
have four quarters (and I can’t have more than four quarters 
because the total would be more than $1). So, if I have three 
quarters, I am left with fourteen dimes/nickels, which must 
add up to 25 cents. That’s impossible, so suppose I have two 
quarters. That leaves 50 cents for the dimes/nickels. I can’t 
get fourteen dimes/nickels that add up to 50 cents. So, try 
one quarter. I have 75 cents left. I can get thirteen nickels and 
one dime to total 75 cents. 

8 
5 



There is also an algebraic way of solving this problem: 

Let’s say I have n nickels, d dimes, and q quarters. The total 

number of coins can be represented as: 

(Equation 1) n + d + q = 15. 

The value of all the coins is: 

(Equation 2) 5n + 10d + 25q = 100, since a nickel is worth 5 


cents, a dime is worth 10 cents, and a quarter is worth 25 cents. 
Let’s divide the second equation by 5. We get: 
(Equation 3) n + 2d + 5q = 20 
Multiply Equation 1 by two: 
(Equation 4) 2n + 2d + 2q = 30 
Subtract Equation 3 from Equation 4. We get: 
(Equation 5) n – 3q = 10 
Now, because of Equation 2, q must be either 1, 2, 3, or 4 and 


not more than 4, since n and d must be both positive numbers. 


We know from Equation 1 that n must be less than 15, since 


d + q must be positive numbers. 


If q = 4, Equation 5 tells us n = 22, which is impossible. 


If q = 3, n = 19, which is impossible. 


If q = 2, n = 16, which is impossible. 


Therefore, q = 1, which makes n = 13 and d = 1. 


Therefore, I have thirteen nickels, one dime, and one quarter.

He could type “The file will be deleted.” 
Think of a statement that will be in conflict with what is 
mentioned. If the user types “The file will be deleted” and the 
statement is true, the file’s name will change but not be deleted. 
Thus the statement “The file is deleted” cannot be true. 
So it is false. But if the statement “The file will be deleted” 
is false, according to what is mentioned in the question, the 
file will be deleted, making the user’s statement true, which 
would be contradictory. So if the user types “The file will be 
deleted,” the computer will not be able to perform a function 
with the file and probably shut down.

Terry is 5 years old. 
Translate words to math. “Alice was five years older than Terry

Now translate again. Terry is half as old as Alice was: T = 
(1/2)a. Substitute for a: 

T = (1/2)(5 + T). 
2T = 5 + T, 
T = 5. 
So, Terry is 5 years old.

Choices (d) negative : positive and (e) disordered : ordered are 
correct. 
An imaginary number is a number such that when multiplied 
by itself it becomes a negative number. However, there is no 
way a real number multiplied by itself will give you a negative 
number. Thus, the term imaginary. For example, two times 
an imaginary number cannot be thought of as greater or less 
than three times the number. Therefore they are called “not 
ordered.” The real numbers are ordered. For example, three 
times the number 25 is greater than two times the number 25.

355 × 356 is greater than 354 × 357. 
There are more than seven ways to answer this question depending 
on how your mind works. One strategy is to find a 
way you can divide to make the problem simpler. The simple 
way is to divide both quantities by 356 × 354. You then get 
to compare 357/356 with 355/354. 357/356 = 1 1/356 and 
355/354 = 1 1/354. So, the original second quantity is greater 
than the original first quantity.

A single 50 percent discount is better. 
It is better to get a single discount of 50 percent. Do not get 
lured into a process that sounds superficial. In fact, it is always 
better to get a single discount of the sums of the successive 
discounts than to get the successive discounts. For example, 
suppose the item was originally $100. A single discount of 50 
percent would give you the item at $50. Now, if I had successive 
discounts of 20 percent and 30 percent, the first 20 
percent discount would give me $80. The second 30 percent 
discount on $80 would give me $56.

and the same thing that causes cancer. So research could find 
that there is a certain condition that causes one to smoke and 
the same condition causes one to have cancer. Thus, smoking

Do this problem in steps by starting with two socks. If you 
get only two socks, they could be different colors, but getting 
three guarantees that you will have a pair. The strategy is to 
realize that in order to be sure of what you get, you have to 
consider the worst-case scenario. The worst case is that if you 
reach in the drawer, you’ll get two different color socks the 
first two tries—let’s say a blue sock and a brown sock the first 
two tries. But the third try you’ll have to get either a blue or 
a brown sock, which will make a pair with one of the first 
two socks.

Thursday 
The key is to realize that “now” must be Friday. Look for 
the phrase in the problem that tells you something you can 
work with and use that with another part of the problem 
to gradually and stepwise lead to a solution. In the phrase 
“Two days from now will be Sunday,” you can see that now 
must be Friday, since two days from Friday is Sunday. Now 
look at the phrase “the day before yesterday.” Yesterday is 
Thursday since now (today) is Friday. “The day before yesterday” 
is Wednesday, and the “day that follows the day before 
yesterday” is Thursday.

50 × 50 × 50 × 50…(100 times) to 100 × 100 × 100 × 100… 
(50 times). Write 100 as 50 × 2, so now you are comparing 50 
× 50 × 50 × 50…(100 times) to 50 × 2 × 50 × 2 × 50 × 2 × 50 
× 2…(50 times).You can now cancel 50 × 50 × 50 × 50…50 
times from both sides of the comparison. You would then get 50 
× 50 × 50 × 50…(50 times) compared with 2 × 2 × 2 × 2…(50 
times). You can see the left side of the comparison is 25 × 25 × 
25 × 25…(50 times) times the right side.

Write a three-digit number with h hundreds digit, t tens digit, and

and C = 9. 
We have 100A + 10B + A – 10C – A = 10A + B. This gives us 
90A + 9B = 10C or 10A + B = (10/9)C.

A powerful strategy in geometry is to draw extra lines to get 
more information from the problem. You may not remember 
this, but when you first took geometry, one of the first proofs 
that the teacher probably showed was “if two sides of a triangle 
are equal, then the base angles are equal.” The teacher 
drew a perpendicular line to start the proof—unfortunately 

9 
8 



the teacher probably did not tell you that the reason she did 
this was because when you draw something you get more 
information and are able to start solving the problem. A natural 
phenomenon! So in this problem, draw a line to make a 
rectangle in the figure and you will find that you will have a 
3-4-5 triangle.

A = [250/100](B). 
x/100 (A) = B. 


Substitute: x/100[(250/100)]B = B. 
Cancel B: x/100[250/100] = 1. 250x/10000 = 1 so 
x = 10,000/250 = 40.

The average rate is less than the average of the rates. 
Average rate = 2AB/(A + B). 
Average of the rates = (A + B)/2. 
Detailed solution: 
From the formula of Rate × Time = Distance, calling the time 


for the car to go uphill, t, and the time for the car to go down


hill, T, with D being the distance downhill and uphill, 


(1) A × t = D and 
(2) B × T = D. 
Now, Average rate = Total distance/Total time. 
So, 
(3) Average rate = 2D/(t + T). 
From (1) we have 
(4) t = D/A 
and from (2) we have 
(5) T = D/B 
Substituting from (4) and (5) in (3), we get 
(6) Average rate = 2D/(D/A + D/B) 
This becomes 
(7) Average rate = 2AB/(A + B) 
But the average of the rates is just (A + B)/2. So we ask, is 
1 
0 
0 



2AB/(A+B) greater, equal to, or less than (A+B)/2? 
So we compare 
2AB/(A+B) with (A+B)/2. 
Put 2AB/(A+B) under a Column A and (A+B)/2 under a 


Column B and let’s compare the Columns: 
Column A Column B 
2AB A + B 
A + B 2 
Now multiply both columns by 2 and then by (A + B). We get 
Column A Column B 
4AB (A + B) (A + B) 

This becomes 
Column A Column B 
4AB A × A + 2AB + B × B 

Now subtract 4AB from both columns. 

We get: 
Column A Column B 
0 

A × A – 2AB + B × B 

But A × A – 2AB + B × B = (A – B)(A – B) so we get: 
Column A Column B 
(A – B) (A – B) 

1 
0 
1 



Since we are told that A and B are different rates, A – B 
cannot be 0, and so (A – B)(A – B) is always greater than 0 
whether A is greater than B or less than B. So Column B is 
greater than Column A and the original quantity in Column 
B, the average of the rates, is greater than the original quantity 
in Column A, the average rate.

Since .AEC = 75, (3) y + x = 75. Subtracting Equation

999 × 1,001 is just 1 less than 1,000 × 1,000. 
One of the key strategies in mathematics is to write what

(1,000 – 1) × (1000 + 1) and you’ll find that’s equal to 
1,000 × 1,000 – 1, since (a –1) × (a +1) = a × a – 1.

A-P-T makes APT, PAT, and TAP;

word—any three-letter word, like TIN. Using those letters, 
T-I-N, can you make another word? Start with T: TNI does 
not make a word. Now methodically use I as the first letter: 
INT and ITN do not make a word. Now start with N: NIT 
and NTI do not make a word—so T-I-N does not work. 

Don’t get discouraged. Try another three-letter word: E-A-T. 
EAT is a word. Start with A now: ATE is a word. Now start 
with T: TEA is a word. Other correct answers are OPT, TOP, 
POT, and ART, RAT, and TAR.

AD × CD is greater than h × AB. 
To solve, label the sides of the parallelogram with letters like 
a and b, then cancel the like quantities. 

AabbhaBCD
h × AB = h × a and AD × CD = b × a 
We are then comparing h × a with b × a. Since the a is the 
same in each expression, we are really comparing h with b, 
and h is less than b because b is the largest side (the hypotenuse) 
of a right triangle. Thus the original h × AB is less than 
AD × CD.

that when you add the digits of a number and subtract

that from the original number you get a number that is a 
perfect multiple of 9. Here’s the proof: Represent the two-
digit number as 10t + u where t is the tens digit and u is the 
units digit. Adding the digits, we get t + u. Subtracting from 
the original number, we get 10t + u – t – u = 9t. Since t is an 
integer, the only choice that fits is (f) 36. What’s more interesting 
is that any number that is a multiple of 9 has digits 
that add up to a multiple of 9. 

Here’s a great parlor trick: Have someone choose a number. 
Then have that person add the digits. Then have the person 
subtract that result from the original number to get a final 
result. Have the person now cross out one of the digits in 
the final answer. You will be able to tell the person what 
digit he crossed out if he tells you the remaining digit. For 
example, he starts with 23. 2 + 3 = 5. 23 – 5 = 18. He 
crosses off the 8. He is left with 1. You will be able to tell 
the digit crossed out. Why? 

Any number that is a multiple of 9 has digits that add up to 
a multiple of 9. So whatever number you crossed out, the 
crossed-out number must be 9 minus the number left!

Understand the difference between “average rate” and the 
“average of the rates.” Then cross-multiply, then subtract 4ab 
from both quantities.

Detailed explanation: The average rate of a car going uphill 
at a miles per hour and downhill at b miles per hour the same 
distance is just 2ab/(a + b). Proof: Call the distance d. Call the 
time it takes for the car to go uphill t. Call the time it takes 
for the car to go downhill the same distance, d, T. Because 
Rate × Time = Distance, 

(1) a × t = d 
(2) b × T = d 
The average rate is the total distance divided by the total 
time. That is 2d/(t + T). 
Using (1), we get t = d/a and (2), T = d/b. 
So 2d/(t +T) = 2d/(d/a + d/b), which can be seen to be just 


2ab/(a + b). 
The average of the rates a and b is just (a + b)/2. 
So Quantity A is just 2ab/(a + b) and 
Quantity B is just (a + b)/2. 
Multiply both quantities by 2. You get 
Quantity A: 4ab/(a + b) 
Quantity B: a + b 
Now multiply both quantities by (a + b). 
You get 
Quantity A: 4ab 


1 
2 
6 



Quantity B: (a + b) × (a + b) = a2 + b2 + 2 × b × a 
Now subtract 4ab from both quantities. You get 
Quantity A: 0 
Quantity B: a2 – 2 × b × a + b2 = (a – b) × (a – b) 
Since a is not equal to b, (a – b) × (a – b) is always greater 

than 0. 
Thus Quantity A is less than Quantity B and so the original 
Quantity A [2ab/(a + b)] is less than the original Quantity B 
[(a + b)/2]. Thus, the average rate of the car going uphill at 
a miles per hour and downhill at b miles per hour is less than 
the average of the rates a and b.

You need to use the formula Rate × Time = Distance, that 
is r × t = d. For the uphill trip, 
r (uphill) × t (uphill) = 1 mile 
For the downhill trip, 


r (downhill) × t (downhill) = 1 mile 
The average rate of the car is the total distance traveled 
(2 miles) divided by the total time traveled, t (uphill) + t 
(downhill). 


Since the average rate was given as 20 mph, 20 = 2 divided by 
[t(uphill) + t(downhill)]. Thus, we get 10 =t(uphill) + t(downhill).

Average speed is total distance divided by total time. So for the 
first half, 25 = 50/time of first half. Thus the time for first half 
is 2 hours. For Phil to average 50 miles per hour for the whole 
trip, we would get 50 = 100/time for the whole trip. Time for 
the whole trip then is 2 hours. That would mean that Phil must 
go an infinite speed the second half of the trip to go 50 miles 
in 0 hours.

Label the 9 coins a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i. First weigh abc with ghi. 
If they balance, then heavy coin is d, e, or f. So weigh d with e. 
If they balance, then the heavy coin is f. If they don’t balance, 
then whichever coin tips the scale is the heavy one. Suppose 
abc and ghi do not balance. Then whichever side tips the scale 
has the heavier coin. Suppose in this case the side with ghi has 
the heavy coin. Then, in the procedure done before, weigh g 
with h. If they balance, then i is heavy. If they don’t balance, 
then the coin that tips the scale downward is heavy. 

Here is a more sophisticated solution: 
Number the coins 1 through 9. In the first weighing, place 
coins 1, 2, and 3 on the left side of the scale, and place 4, 5, 
and 6 on the right side. Leave 7, 8 and 9 on the side. For the 
second weighing, regardless of the results of the first, place 
coins 1, 4, and 7 on the left, and place 2, 5, and 8 on the 
right. The following chart demonstrates how to determine 
which is the heaviest coin depending on these results. In this

He or she should open the remaining door. 
The probability would be 2/3, not 1/2! Many people have 
thought that there is a 1/2 chance of having the car behind 
the door the contestant chose since there are two doors. 
However, because you have chosen a door first, out of three, 
there is a 1/3 probability there is a car behind it, and there 
would be a 2/3 probability any other door has the car behind 
it. So if you chose two of the other doors, you would have 
a 2/3 probability of the car. And if one door was eliminated 

1 
3 
6 



by the host, since that door had the goat, if you switched 
doors, then it would be in effect as if you were choosing two 
doors, which would give you the 2/3 probability that the car 
was behind the remaining door. 

Another explanation: 
Interestingly enough, the answer is that the contestant should 
switch doors, because there is actually a 2/3 chance of winning 

the car by switching, while there is only a 1/3 chance of winning 
the car if the contestant opens his or her original door! 
This is how most people’s minds approach the problem: The 

host eliminates one door with the goat, so there is a goat or 
a car behind the contestant’s door. So the probability is 1/2. 
And it doesn’t matter whether the contestant opens his or 
her original door or changes doors. But let’s see what is really 
happening. The probability of having a car behind the contestant’s 
door when he or she originally chooses the door is 1/3, 
since there are three doors and only one door that has a car 
behind it. And there is a 2/3 probability that the car is behind 
one of the other two doors (since there are two ways a car 
can be behind one of the remaining doors [car-goat; goat-car] 
out of a total of three possibilities: car-goat; goat-car; goat-
goat). Now, if the host eliminates a door, there would still be 
the 1/3 probability that the car was behind the contestant’s 
original door—so once a door is eliminated, there is a 2/3 
probability the car was behind the remaining door.

I have pondered the Let’s Make a Deal problem for some 
time, and I came to the conclusion that it is 2/3 when I took 
a more dramatic variation of the problem. Suppose I had 
100 doors and 1 of them had a car behind it. The rest had 
goats. If I chose one door, there would no doubt be a 1/100 
chance that there was a car behind it. So the remaining doors 
combined would have a 99/100 chance of the car. Now no 
matter what was done to the other doors, there would still 
be a 1/100 chance of the car’s being behind the door that 
was chosen. So if the host knew that 98 of the doors did not 
have the car, and then eliminated those doors, the remaining 
door then must have had a 99/100 chance that there was a 
car behind it. 

Suppose you had 100 doors. The chance of the car’s being behind 
the contestant’s chosen door is 1/100, obviously a very 
slim chance that won’t change even when the host eliminates 
98 doors. When the doors are eliminated, and all but two are 
left, the contestant still has chosen a door with a very, very 
slim chance the car is behind it, namely 1/100. Because the 
host knows where the car is (and where the goats are), and 
because 98 of the goats were eliminated, the remaining door 
has a (98 + 1)/100 chance there is a car behind it. 

Note that initial reasoning may indicate that when there is 
only one door left, since 98 doors have been eliminated, the 
total number of possibilities for what’s behind the contestant’s 

1 
3 
8 



door is two, a car or a goat. The favorable number of possibilities 
is one, the car. So by strict definition of probability, 
the probability is 1/2 no matter what the host knows or did. 
But according to the previous paragraph, that is not the case. 

I think probability has a somewhat ambiguous definition, especially 
if there is “conditional” probability, but it seems that 
if you tried the 100 doors out you would in fact find you’d get 
a 1/100 chance of getting the car.

Call x the number of boxes with 6 donuts, y the number 
of boxes with 9 donuts, and z the number of boxes with 20 
donuts. Then the total number of donuts, N, for x, y, z boxes 
is represented by N = 6x + 9y + 20z, or N = 3(2x + 3y) + 20z. 
Now x = 0, 1, 2, 3 etc., y = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., z = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. 

20z can be 20, 40, 60, etc.

Look at the first numbers in the parts of the sequence:

Third = 4

Note the first number of the parts of the sequence increase 

by 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. 

(If you add 1 to the first number, you get the second. If you 

add 2 to the second number, you get the third. If you add 3 

to the third number, you get the fourth. If you add 4 to the 

fourth number, you get the fifth.) 

So, the first number, call it N in the nth part of the sequence is 

1: N = 1 + [1 + 2 + 3 + … + (n – 1)] 
Now write this again backwards: 
2: N = 1 + [(n – 1) + (n – 2) + (n – 3) + … + 1] + 1

Adding (1) and (2), we get 2N = 1 + [(1 + n – 1) + (2 + n – 2)

This is just equal to 2N = 1 + 1 + [n taken (n – 1) times], or 
just 2 + n (n – 1). 
So N = [2 + n(n – 1)]/2. So, if n = 100, then 
N = [2 + 100(99)]/2 = [2 + 9,900]/2 = 4,951

PBQ, PQ2 = PB2 +BQ2 = 22 + 22 = 8 = QA2 – AP2. 

Hence, by the converse of the Pythagorean theorem in triangle 
PQA, we know that .APQ = 90°. However, as triangle 
PBQ is right-angled and isosceles, .BPQ = 45°. 

Therefore, .APB = .APQ + .BPQ = 90° + 45° = 135°.

Probability can be defined as the favorable number of possible

Since one of the coins lands as a head, the total number of 
ways this is possible is the following: 


five-cent head, ten-cent tail 
five-cent head, ten-cent head 
five-cent tail, ten-cent head 
There couldn’t be a possibility of a ten-cent tail, ten-cent tail 


combination because we are told that one of the coins must 
be a head.

Now, the favorable ways that the five-cent coin will land as

(b) The equivalent discount of each of the three items is between 
70 percent and 80 percent. 
Suppose we start with a price of $100 for each item. After 
the first discount, the first item will be $40. After the second 
discount, the item will be $24. This would represent an 
equivalent discount of 76 percent. Use the same process for 
the second and third item. For the second item, we would 
find that the price after the second discount is $25, which 
would represent an equivalent discount of 75 percent. For 
the third item, we would find the equivalent discount to be 
79 percent. Thus, (b) is correct.

Represent the digits as a, b, c, d. So (1) a = (1/3)b, (2) c = a 

+ b, and (3) d = 3b. 
From (1) we get (4) 3a = b. From (3) and (4) we get (5) d = 
9a. The only way (5) can be true is if a = 1, since d is a single 
digit and not equal to 0, making d = 9. Thus, from (1) b = 3, 
and from (2) c = 4. So the number abcd is 1,349.

They are both lying. 
Scenario 1: If the child with brown hair is lying, he is a boy. 
Then the child with blond hair must be a girl since there is a 
boy and a girl and thus is also lying. 

Scenario 2: If the child with brown hair is not lying, then 
she’s a girl. Since at least one of them is lying, the child with 
blond hair must be lying and would be a girl also, which is

Method 1: First weigh six balls with six balls. Whichever of the six 
balls tips the scale, that is where the heavier ball is. So now 
from those balls, weigh three against three. Again whichever 
of the three tips the scale is where the heavier ball is. So of the 
three balls (where one of them is heavier than the other two) 
weigh one against one. If they balance, the heavier ball is the 
remaining one. If they don’t balance, whichever ball tips the 
scale is the heavier one. 
Method 2: First weigh four balls with four balls. Suppose 
they balance. Then weigh the remaining four balls—two 
balls against two balls. Whichever two balls tip the scale 
downward include the heavier ball. So weigh one of those 
balls against the other. Whichever ball tips the scale downward 
is the heavier ball. 

Suppose when we weigh the four balls against four balls, 
they don’t balance. The four balls that tip the scale downward 
have one of the balls that is heavier. So take these four 
balls and weigh two against two. One of the two balls will 
tip the scale downward. Whichever of the two balls tips the 
scale downward contains the heavy ball. Now weigh one 

1 
4 
9 



of those balls with the other. The one that tips the scale 


downward is the heavy ball. 
Method 3: First weigh three against three. If they balance, 
then weigh the other three against three. Certainly one side 
will be heavier so weigh the three balls where one is heavier, 
one against one. If they balance, it’s the remaining ball that 
is heavier. If they don’t balance, the ball that tips the scale 
downward is heavier. 


If the original three against three don’t balance, take the three 
balls that tip the scale downward and weigh two of those 
balls, one on one side, the other on the other. If they balance, 
it’s the remaining ball. If they don’t balance, it’s the ball that 
tips the scale downward.

The man is 52 and his wife is 39. 
Denote the man’s age now as M, the wife’s age now as W, the 
man’s age when he was as old as the wife now as m, the wife’s 
age when the man was as old as she is now as w. 

Then we get 

(1) M + W = 91 
(2) m = W (since the man was then as old as the wife now) 
1 
5 
0 



(3) M = 2w (since the man is twice as old as the wife was) 
The key thing to realize is that the difference in ages between 
the man and his wife now is the same difference then or at 
any other time. That is, 


(4) M – W = m – w 
So substituting (2) and (3) into (4), we get 
M – W = W – M/2 or M – W = (2W – M)/2, which gives us 
2M – 2W = 2W – M, so we get 


(5) 3M = 4W or M = 4W/3 
We substitute (5) into (1) and we get: 
4W/3 + W = 91; 7W/3 = 91 and W = 273/7 = 39. From (1) 
we get M + 39 = 91, and so M = 52.

45/50 or 90 percent 
n = nickels, p = pennies, q = quarters, d = dimes 


We have 5n + p + 10d + 25q = 100 (since the total is 100 
cents) and n + p + d + q = 50 (since the total is 50 coins). 
Subtract the two equations: 
We get 4n + 9d + 24q = 50. 
Suppose q = 1. Then 4n + 9d + 24 = 50, and so 4n + 9d = 26. 


1 
5

The only way this is possible is if d = 2 and n = 2. 


Suppose q = 2. Then 4n + 9d + 48 = 50, and we get 4n + 9d = 2, 
which is impossible. 
So we have 1 quarter, 2 dimes, and 2 nickels, which leaves 


45 pennies since the total number of coins is 50. If I drop 1 
penny, we have the probability as 45/50 or 90 percent.

Translate: The number of apples that Bill bought = B, 
that Harry bought = H, and that Martin bought = M. “Bill 
bought four times as many apples as Harry” translates to B 
= 4H. Similarly B = 3M. “Bill, Harry, and Martin purchased 
a total of less than 190 apples” translates to B + H + M < 

190. You will find that manipulating these equations, we 
get B < 120. However, because H and M are integers, B = 
108 and not 119! 
Here’s the complete solution: 

(1) B + H + M < 190 
(2) B = 4H 
(3) B = 3M

Substituting (3) into (1) we get 

(4) 3M + H + M < 190 
From (2) and (3), we get 
(5) 3M = 4H and so 
(6) H = 3M/4 
Substituting (6) into (4) we get 
(7) 3M + 3M/4 + M < 190 
This becomes 
(8) 19M/4 < 190 and thus 
(9) M/4 < 10, so M < 40. So at this point you might think 
that M = 39. And from (3), B becomes 117. But from (6) we 
wouldn’t have H as a whole number! The greatest number 
less than 40 which the whole number M could be for (6) to 
be true is M = 36. Then H = 27, and from (3), B = 108.

Let’s see what numbers would be on the vertices of the 
triangle. Represent those numbers by a, b, and c. Let the 
numbers 1 through 9 be represented by a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, 

i. Then we have 
(1) a + e + d + b = 17 
(2) b + f + g + c = 17 
(3) c + h + i + a = 17 
(4) a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i = 45 (since all the numbers 
1 + 2 + 3…9 add up to 45) 
Adding (1), (2), (3) we get 

(5) 2a + 2b + 2c + d + e + f + g + h + i = 51.

Subtracting (4) from (5) we get a + b + c = 6. The only way 

this can be possible is if the numbers for a, b, and c are 1, 2, 3. 
So start with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 at the vertex of the triangle. 
For the left side, since the numbers must add up to 17, 
the other two numbers on the left side must add up to 14. The 
only possibilities are 6 and 8 or 5 and 9. If it is 5 and 9, then the 
remaining numbers are 4, 6, 7, 8. For the bottom side, two of 
these numbers (of 4, 6, 7, 8) must add up to 17 – 5 = 12. The 
only way is 4 and 8. So then we’d have 6 and 7 left. For the 
right side, 1 + 3 + 6 + 7 adds up to 16. Similarly you can see 
that for the left side 6 and 8 also works and we get the triangle 
on the right.

(c) There is the same amount of water in the alcohol as alcohol in 
the water. 
Let’s say the cup of alcohol you pour in the water contains c 
gallons (c could be 1/10, for example). Now the water bucket 
has a mixture of alcohol and water. Now you pour one cup 
(again, c gallons) of that mixture back into the alcohol bucket. 
Let’s say there are a gallons of alcohol and w gallons of water 
in that cup. So (1) a + w = c. 

Now the amount of water poured into the alcohol is w. The 
amount of alcohol in the water bucket is c – a, since we 
poured a gallons of alcohol into the alcohol bucket from the 
water bucket. From (1) we get c – a = w, so (c) is true.

Write an equation, where n is the number of nickels, d is 
the number of dimes, and q is the number of quarters: 
5n + 10d + 25q = 100. Start with the smallest numbers for n, 
d, and q that satisfy the equation. Start with n = 0, d = 0, then 
q = 4, which is not true since the most q can be is 3. Then 
try n = 0, d = 1. Then we get 25q = 90, which doesn’t give 
us a whole number for q. You will find that if n = 1, d = 2, 
and q = 3, and if n = 3, d = 1, and q = 3, you will satisfy the 
equation. So there are two ways to make change.

mention that the fish give off a “strange glow.” Choices (c)

Triangle BCD is then a right triangle and is a 3-4-5 right triangle. 
Now you have triangle BAD as a 5-12-13 triangle. This 
is also a right triangle. (In high school you prove these things 
by using the Pythagorean theorem, but usually students are 
told to remember certain right triangles like the popular 
3-4-5 and 5-12-13 ones.) So if triangle BAD is a right triangle 
(where angle ABD is a right angle), you can show the area is 
(5 × 12)/2 = 30. The area of triangle BCD is (3 × 4)/2 = 6, so 
the total area of the figure is 36.

In order for the horse to move, the horse pushes back on the 
ground. This makes the ground push back on the horse (this is 
actually Newton’s third law). Thus, there is a force exerted by 
the ground on the horse, which enables the horse to move with 
the cart.

So you don’t have to rack your brain in a verbal math problem, 
always translate “what” to x, “percent” to /100, “of ” to × 
(times), and “is” to =. In the problem above, you would get:

What percent of 5 is 20? 

f f f fff

 x / 100 × 5 = 20 
This becomes: (x/100) × 5 = 20. 
Now here’s another strategy. Get rid of the fractions! Multiply 

both sides of the equation above by 100. You get: 
(x)(5) 100 = 20 × 100 
100 
and you find 
(x)(5) = 20 × 100 = 2,000; Divide both sides of the equation 

by 5: x = 400.

First weighing: four against four 
Second weighing: two against two 
Third weighing: one against one 
Try to find a set of balls as “reference” balls, none of which is 


the heavy or light ball. 
Note that even though the scale may tip downward in one di


rection, the heavy ball may not be on the “downward” part of 
the scale; it may be that the lighter ball is on the upward side. 
Let’s work through the solution: 
Identify balls by number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 
(1, 2, 3) ? (4, 5, 6) means you weigh 1, 2, 3 vs. 4, 5, 6 
If the result of weighing is (1, 2, 3) < (4, 5, 6), it means first 


group (1, 2, 3) is lighter than the second, (4, 5, 6). 
(1, 2, 3) > (4, 5, 6) means the first group (1, 2, 3) is heavier. 
(1, 2, 3) = (4, 5, 6) means both groups (1, 2, 3) and (4, 5, 6) 


weigh the same and so all the balls in that group are normal. 
N represents a normal ball. 
Divide 12 balls into 3 groups: (1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8), (9, 10, 11, 12). 
First weighing: weigh (1, 2, 3, 4) ? (5, 6, 7, 8) 
CASE 1: Where (1, 2, 3, 4) = (5, 6, 7, 8) 
This means that the odd ball is in (9, 10, 11, 12) and that 1, 


2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are normal (N) 


1 
7 
8 



Second weighing: weigh (N, 9) ? (10, 11) 
If (N, 9) = (10, 11) 
This means the odd ball is 12. 
Third weighing: weigh (12) ? (N). 
If (12) > (N) then 12 is the heavy ball. If (12) < (N), then 12 


is the light ball. 


If in the second weighing, (N, 9) > (10, 11), then either 9 is 
heavy or 10 or 11 is light. 
Third weighing: weigh (10) ? (11). 
If (10) > (11), then 11 is light and 9 is normal. If (10) < (11), 


then 10 is light. 
If in weighing (10) ? (11), (10) = (11), then 9 must be heavy. 
If in the second weighing, (N, 9) < (10, 11), you can similarly 


reason that 9 is light or 10 or 11 is heavy. 
And then in the third weighing, weigh (10) ? (11). 
If (10) > (11), then 10 is heavy. If (10) < (11), then 11 is 


heavy. If (10) = (11), then 9 is light. 
CASE 2: Where in the first weighing, (1, 2, 3, 4) > (5, 6, 7, 8) . 
Then you know that 9, 10, 11, 12 are normal (N), and one of 


the balls 1, 2, 3, 4 is heavy or one of the balls 5, 6, 7, 8 is light. 
Second weighing: weigh (N, 1, 2) ? (3, 4, 5) 
If (N, 1, 2) = (3, 4, 5) then the odd ball is in (6, 7, 8) and is 


1 
7 
9 



lighter, so weigh (6) ? (7) and pick the lightest. If (6) = (7) then 
8 is light. 
If (N, 1, 2) > (3, 4, 5), (3, 4) are normal, so odd is in (1, 2, 5). 
Third weighing: weigh (1) ? (2). 
If (1) > (2) then 1 is heavy; if (1) < (2), then 2 is heavy; if 


(1) = (2), then 5 is light. 
Second weighing: For the case where (N, 1, 2) < (3, 4, 5), 
the odd ball is in (3, 4) and is heavy, since 5 can’t be heavy, 
and (1, 2), which were in the heavy group originally, are not 
the heavy ones, now. 
Third weighing: So weigh (3) ? (4). If (3) > (4), 3 is heavy. If 


(3) < (4), then 4 is heavy. 
CASE 3: Where in the first weighing, (1, 2, 3, 4) < (5, 6, 7, 8). 
Second weighing: weigh (N, 1, 2) ? (3, 4, 5). If (N, 1, 2) = 
(3, 4, 5), odd ball is in (6, 7, 8) and is heavier, so weigh (6) ? 


(7) (third weighing) and pick the heaviest. If (6) = (7), then 
8 is heavy. 
If (N, 1, 2) > (3, 4, 5), the odd ball is in (3, 4) and is light, 
since according to the first weighing, (5) can’t be light and (1, 
2) cannot be heavy. 


Third weighing: So weigh (3) ? (4). If (3) > (4), then 4 is 
light. If (3) < (4), then 3 is light. 
If in the second weighing, (N, 1, 2) < (3, 4, 5), then either 

1 
8 
0 



(1,2) is light or 5 is heavy because of the first weighing. 
Third weighing: So weigh (1) ? (2). If (1) > (2), then 2 is light. 
If (1) < (2), then 1 is light. If (1) = (2), then 5 is heavy. 

208. 
(b) The third student’s hat can be white. 
Think of what information you get by knowing that both the 
first and second students cannot figure out the color of their 
hats. 

The color of the third student’s hat is red. He reasons, “If I 
can prove it’s impossible that I have a white hat, then I must 
have a red hat.” There are only three scenarios in which the 
last student could have a white hat: 

(1) if the first student has a red hat and the second student 
has a white hat, 
(2) if the first student has a white hat and the second student 
has a red hat, and 
(3) if both the first and second students have red hats. 
Scenario (1) is ruled out because the first student would 
have known his hat was red if the other two students had 
white hats, since there were only two white hats in the 
original bag. Scenario (2) is ruled out because the second 
student would have made the same deduction. Scenario (3) 

1 
8 
1 



is ruled out because the second student would have known 
she was wearing a red hat if the third student was wearing 
a white hat, because otherwise the first student would have 
seen that they were both wearing white hats. But because 
the second student did not know or figure out that she was 
wearing a red hat, the third student could not be wearing a 
white hat. Thus the only combinations are (where A, B, C 
denote first, second, third student respectively): 

A—White; B—White; C—Red 
A— White; B—Red; C—Red 
A—Red; B—White; C—Red 
A—Red; B—Red; C—Red 
Thus, (b) is correct.

Translate from words to math. Let S be the ship’s age now; 
B is the boiler’s age now; s is the ship’s age then; and b is the 
boiler’s age then. You would get: 

(1) S = 2b 
(2) s = B 
(3) B/S unknown

8 
2 



(4) B – b = S – s, because B – b and S – s represents the same 
passage of time. 
Substituting (1) in the left side of (4) and (2) in the right 
side of (4), we get: 

(5) B – S/2 = S – B 
Thus, we get: 
(6) 2B = 3S/2 or 
(7) B/S = 3/4 
210.

Call females F1, F2, F3, and call males M1, M2, M3. The 
total number of combinations of three people, such as F1, F2, 
M1 and F1, M2, M3, etc., is six combinations taken three at a 
time, or 6C3, which is equal to (6 × 5 × 4) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 20. 
The favorable number of combinations is nine: 

M1, M2, F1 
M1, M2, F2 
M1, M2, F3 
M1, M3, F1 
M1, M3, F2 
M1, M3, F3

M2, M3, F1

Thus the probability of only two males in the room is favor


able ways / total ways = 9/20.

the GeoMetry ProbleM that StuMPed

Solution 

1. 
Draw EF parallel to BC. Then angle DFE = 80º because of equal 
corresponding angles of parallel lines. 
2. 
Drop a perpendicular line to BC from A, hitting BC at G. Because 
of congruent triangles ABG and AGC, angle BAG = angle CAG = 
10º. 
3. 
Now draw line FC, calling H the point where line FC intersects line 
BE. Line AG passes through point H, because of symmetry. 
4. 
Angle BHC = 60º since the other angles of the triangle BHC are 
both 60º. 
5. 
BE = FC (because of corresponding sides of congruent triangles 
FBC and EBC). BH = HC (call BH b) because triangle BHC is 
isosceles. So by subtraction, FH = HE. 
1 
8 
5 



6. 
Since angle FHE = 60º (vertical angle to BHC), and because 
FH = HE from 5, angle FHE = angle HEF = 60º, so triangle 
FHE is equilateral. Thus, FE = FH = HE. Call each of those sides 
a. 
7. 
Now AF = AE (because AB = AC and FB = EC, by subtraction 
AF = AE). 
8. 
Because triangle AEB is isosceles, AE = BE = b + a. Thus, 
AF = BE = b + a (since AF = AE from 7). 
9. 
BE = FC (congruent triangles BEC and BFC), so AF = FC, since 
AF = BE from 8. 
10. 
Now watch this: Triangle AFH is congruent to triangle 
CFD because AF = FC; angle AFH = 140º = angle CFD; 
angle DCF = 10º = angle FAH. Thus, corresponding sides of 
the congruent triangles AFH and triangle CFD are equal, so 
FH = FD. But FH = FE from 6, so FE = FD. 
11. 
Since FE = FD, angle FDE = angle FED and since angle DFE = 80º 
from (1), angle FDE = 50º = angle FED. 
12. 
But angle FDC = 30º, so by subtraction, angle EDC = 20º!

about the author about the author 
Gary R. Gruber, PhD, is recognized nationally as the leading expert on 
standardized tests and originator and developer of the critical-thinking 
skills necessary for use on standardized tests. It is said that no one in 
the nation is better at assessing the thinking patterns of how a person 
answers questions and providing the mechanism to improve the faulty 
thinking approaches. Dr. Gruber’s SAT score improvements with students 
have been documented to be the highest in the nation. 

Dr. Gruber’s unique methods have been used by the Public 
Broadcasting Service (PBS), Sylvan Learning Centers, and Grolier’s 
Encyclopedia, and they are being used by school districts throughout 
the country, in homes and workplaces across the nation, and by a 
host of other entities. Most recently he has trained the University of 
California’s teachers to create programs for specific critical-thinking 
and problem-solving skills for their minority programs. 


Dr. Gruber holds a doctorate in physics and has published more 
than thirty-five books with major publishers on test-taking and 
critical-thinking methods, with over seven million copies sold. He 
has also authored over one thousand articles in both scholarly journals 
as well as in newspapers syndicated nationally, has appeared 
on numerous television and radio shows, and has been interviewed 
in hundreds of publications. He has developed major programs 
for school districts and for city and state educational agencies for 
improving and restructuring curriculum, increasing learning ability 
and test scores, increasing motivation, developing a passion 
for learning and problem solving, and decreasing student dropout 
rates. His results have been lauded throughout the country by 
people from all walks of life. 

His mission is to get the nation impassioned with learning and 
problem solving so that people don’t merely try to get a quick answer, 
but actually enjoy and look forward to solving the problem and 
learning. With this approach, Dr. Gruber believes that we’d have a 
nation of critical thinkers who would find problem solving enjoyable. 
Because of Dr. Gruber’s tenacity, passion, and creativity for solving 
problems, and having used the strategies he has developed and honed 
for years, the Washington Post has called him “the super genius.”
